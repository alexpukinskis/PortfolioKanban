* Fix scrollbar issue so that longer sets of cards can be seen
* Correctly use passed in object name (such as 'Children') to determine what to display
   goal is to use this generally for tasks and defect
* Click through on a PI to see a board containing just it's children
* Figure out correct custom field for Kanban Column and display that. (AP: this would be great SDK component)
